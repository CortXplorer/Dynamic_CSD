	2. type git help <command> (opens html on default browser of that command and all modifications of it)

Good Git Practices that Katrina will complain about you not doing:
***
	1. Write good commit messages
		* Because we should be able to skim the list of changes and understand basically what has happened
	2. Write good variable names
		* Because we will now be merging codes so we'll have all of the same names. Naming things appropriately and uniquely as a habit will make merging and sharing simpler (no temps, dummies, or fucks without an additional modifier - i.e. dummycsdlayer)
	3. Make small commits when possible
		* Imagine the commit message, you should be able to summarize the change in a sentence or phrase - this practice will ensure the simplicity and readability of changes and tracking
		* SO - if you want to make a bunch of changes, commit one change at a time!
	4. Before you Push all of your code changes, Pull the online directory to sync locally 
		* This will massively simplify any merge conflicts that arise as you will be able to handle them locally
	5. Make experimental changes to branches before messing with the master
		* Because people are using the master and we need to test out your changes with out various circumstances before making a commitment 
	6. Request a merge with the master 
        * So that at least one other member must double check changes 
	7. Write good messages when assigning tasks to other users
	8. Write good documentation explaining your functions
	9. UPDATE documentation in functions if you altered the function
	10. Comment the code
			* We are beginning true collaborative code and will absolutely need to be considering readability and clarity for other users
