These may be modified for new purposes but should be copied to another area so that the integrety of the Pipeline here remains in tact. The Pipeline_Deane2020 in this folder describes the input and output of each step used to generate all figures and statistics associated with the project.

Data for this project can be found at TBA. 
Group Data should be place in ../Dynamic_CSD/DATA;
